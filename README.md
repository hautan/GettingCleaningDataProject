# Getting and Cleaning Data

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, 
merges train and test data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set project at the UCI Machine Learning 
Repository to produce averages values per user per activity for the dataset's mean and standard deviation features only. 

The end result of the script is the file tidydata.txt.
The data is in wide format: there is a single row for each subjectID/activity label pair, and a single column for each measurement.

 A detailed description of the variables can be found in codebook.md
